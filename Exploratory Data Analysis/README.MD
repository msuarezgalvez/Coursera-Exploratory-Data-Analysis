Exploratory Data Analysis <br />

Now we will apply EDA to a real-world dataset which is useful for data science projects. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project: <br />

-Defining Exploratory Data Analysis with an overview of the whole project <br />
-Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset <br />
-Checking missing values and Outliers <br />
-Creating visual methods to analyze the data <br />
-Analyzing trends, patterns, and relationships in the Data While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above-mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning.
